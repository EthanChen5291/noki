current 'typing games'?
current 'rhythm games'?

- NICHE: seeks to appeal to both musicians, keyboard enthusiasts, and rhythm gamers. friendly to beginners but also open to pros.
- introducing the keyboard rather than arrow keys introduces a higher complexity, but it gives us more lee-way to design fun, ergonomically-satisfying levels. more creative liberty.
- satisfying, home-made UI
- CONVENIENCE: as an audio designer and developer myself, I'll be able to compose music and sync music directly to gameplay to compliment the engine.
- aidan is the artist. check out his instagram @bokuart

- WORDS -> what are they typing? take advantage:
- poems on 'deep' songs. comedy on 'fun' songs. simple sentences for 'learning' songs.

- UNIQUE STANDPOINT
- have a story, with the user being able to choose between typing multiple preset messages e.g "I forgive you" / "I despise you" (both of which are synced up to the song) that could lead to different outcomes in the story of the game as well as POSSIBLY affect the song outcome too. BREAKING THE THIRD DIMENSION by being a more unique story-driven game.
- show letters falling down from the top or rolling from right to left?
  
(instead of a piano on the bottom, there is a keyboard) 

- same mechanics as falling tiles, but since there's multiple layers, I'll typically avoid having multiple keys come down at once within proximity of each other to reduce viewing confusion.
- one pro with this is that there is no pressure to keep keys constant - the key 'C' can represent one note in one song and another in another song and it'd still help with typing.
- for more viewing convenience, I'll have the key on the keyboard to be played gradually become more highlighted over time as the note tile travels down
- "what happens if the user plays a certain key outside of when it's supposed to be played?" -> maps to a random note used within the song
- IMPACT: good way to help typing on keyboard - DUEL MODE -> only one area of keyboard, using mouse too to DO SOMETHING with mouse (kinda like waltz with keyboard as piano and mouse as violin)
- even a direct fighting mode (like making cutting slashes with mouse and it's like a waltz fighting a boss)?
