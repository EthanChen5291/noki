### ==== BRAINSTORMING ==== ###

# allows user customizability in designing levels/music (custom word bank per level, custom music)
# algorithm that maps words to bpm in a ergonomically satisfying way

APPEAL/sell to user
# 6 default progression levels, each level with a specific word bank (music finished) to demonstrate 
# Journey, Classic, Master modes. Visualizer: (counted as checkmark on level (Journey accomplished), star (Classic accomplished), and cat crown (Master mode accomplished))

MAIN ALGORITHM
# custom levels -> should be VERY LITTLE work for user to make levels (lessons)
# show popular song library? should every song have a min/max duration (add an "optimize" option)

# figure out optimal char/song_len ratio for JOURNEY, CLASSIC, and MASTER modes

FUTURE
# have an AI that can:
# 1. add X words to word bank by finding similar words in DIFFICULTY and CHARS_USED
# 2. add X words to word bank by finding similar words in DIFFICULTY but covering the less covered chars
# 3. cut X words from word bank that are cover chars that are too similar 

ART
#### style: constant brush thickness (no pressure sensor), simplistic with smooth animation 
# art ref: check out friday night funkin

# cat shaking head animation (loop)

# THREE cat emote animations for CORRECT notes (happy) 
#      -> VERY QUICK -> should return back to cat shaking head

# THREE cat emote animations for INCORRECT notes (sad)
#      -> VERY QUICK -> should return back to cat shaking head

# speakers booming animation (loop)
# floating music notes coming out of speakers

# 6 BACKGROUNDS, one for each song (very simple ones!)
